# Heroine Dusk™

Version 1.2

Heroine Dusk™ is a basic dungeon crawl made using an old aesthetic. It began as my April OneGameAMonth project.

The game's world is set in a fantasy human realm where the sun has not returned in several days. Evil forces are using the safety of night to invade. You are a serf woman takes up arms to fight against the darkness.
